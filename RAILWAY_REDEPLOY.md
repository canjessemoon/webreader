# Railway Redeployment Guide

Follow these steps to redeploy your WebReader application on Railway with the fixes for the content extraction issues.

## 1. Update Your Deployment on Railway

### Automatic Deployment (If connected to GitHub)

If you've connected your GitHub repository to Railway, simply pushing the latest changes should trigger an automatic redeploy. You can verify this by:

1. Go to your [Railway dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Select your WebReader project
3. Check the "Deployments" tab to see if a new deployment is in progress

### Manual Redeployment

If automatic deployment isn't set up:

1. Go to your [Railway dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Select your WebReader project
3. Click the "Deploy" button to manually trigger a new deployment
4. Select the latest commit from your GitHub repository

## 2. Verify the Deployment

After deployment is complete:

1. Open your Railway app URL (https://webreader-production.up.railway.app/)
2. Try extracting content from a simple website, such as:
   - https://example.com
   - https://developer.mozilla.org
   - https://reactjs.org

## 3. What's Fixed in This Deployment

The latest changes include a robust fallback system that should resolve the "No content found on this page" issue:

1. **Dynamic Proxy System**:
   - The app now automatically tries multiple CORS proxies if the internal one fails
   - Includes 4 different public proxies as fallbacks

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Better error messages for different types of failures
   - Automatic retry with different proxies when a request fails

3. **Railway-Specific Configuration**:
   - Added Railway configuration files
   - Set up environment detection to use appropriate settings on Railway

## 4. If Issues Persist

If you still see "No content found on this page" after deploying:

1. Open the browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check the console for error messages
3. Try a different URL - some websites may have strict security that blocks all proxies
4. Verify that the public proxies are available (they occasionally have usage limits)

## 5. Monitoring and Logs

Railway provides excellent logging capabilities:

1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on the "Deployments" tab
3. Select the current deployment
4. Click "View Logs" to see runtime logs
5. Look for "[PROXY]" prefixed messages which show the content extraction process

## Next Steps

Consider the following to further improve your deployment:

1. **Custom Domain**: Set up a custom domain in Railway settings 
2. **Environment Variables**: Add a `CORS_PROXY_LIST` environment variable to specify additional proxies
3. **Monitoring**: Set up Railway alerts to notify you of any issues
