# Railway Healthcheck Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the Railway healthcheck issues.

## Problem

The WebReader application was failing at the healthcheck stage on Railway with the error:
```
Attempt #14 failed with service unavailable. Continuing to retry for 15s
1/1 replicas never became healthy!
Healthcheck failed!
```

## Root Causes

1. **Railway Healthcheck Configuration**: The healthcheck was pointing to the root path (`/`) but our health endpoint was at `/health`
2. **ES Modules Compatibility**: Railway's deployment system was having issues with ES Modules
3. **Port Binding**: The server wasn't properly binding to the port that Railway expected

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Updated Railway Configuration**
   - Changed healthcheck path to `/healthz` in `railway.json`
   - Added multiple health check endpoints to cover all possibilities
   - Created a boot script (`railway-boot.sh`) to ensure proper startup

2. **Added CommonJS Server Alternative**
   - Created `server-railway.js` as a CommonJS version of our server
   - Boot script tries this version first before falling back to ES Modules

3. **Enhanced Port Binding**
   - Updated server to bind to `0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces
   - Ensured the PORT environment variable is properly captured

4. **Added Multiple Health Check Endpoints**
   - `/health` - Original health check endpoint
   - `/healthz` - Standard Kubernetes-style health endpoint
   - Added JSON response to root path for direct health checks

## How to Verify the Fix

After deploying these changes, you can verify the fix by:

1. Checking Railway deployment logs - you should see the server starting successfully
2. Accessing the `/healthz` endpoint directly - it should return a JSON response with status "ok"
3. The main application should load correctly at the root URL

## Further Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Add more detailed error handling for Railway-specific issues
2. **Custom Logging**: Consider adding a Railway-specific logger that formats logs for their platform
3. **Monitoring**: Add more detailed monitoring of server health metrics
